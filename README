NAME
    Game of Nim - A simple web-based take on the classic Nim

DESCRIPTION
    This is a web-based implementation of the Game of Nim, designed to be run
    in a browser. Nim is a simple game where two players (in this case, one
    player and the computer) take turns removing tokens from a set. Multiple
    tokens can be removed at once but only from one group at a time. The
    objective of the game is to take the last token.
    
    The game is written in JavaScript and follows the module pattern. The code
    mainly consists of generating a random array of token objects which have
    UI events bound to them. For example, when a player clicks on a token, a
    function is called to simulate the computer's turn, which uses a simple
    algorithm to determine the best token selection. The game also has
    functionality for displaying help and tracking the number of games won.
